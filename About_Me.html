    <a href="https://www.rediguana.com" target="_blank">Favorite Restaurant</a>
<p>A favorite restaurant in Utah, I originally discovered it from a recommendation via my buddies dad. It was featured
    on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. They serve Mexican food. My favorite dish is Tacos Don Ramon!</p>
<h2>Steak:</h2>
<p><img src="Steak.png" style="float:left;width:200px;height:200px;">
My favorite dish to make is Steak, I commonly use a sou vede to get the exact temperature of the steak perfectly. I then
sear the steak using a very hot cast iron skillet. I prefer to get good cuts of meat and just use salt and pepper. In
the industry they would say; let the meat do the talking!
